This Repo is your blueprint for leveraging AWS services like ECR, S3, DynamoDB, and EC2, with Terraform as the backbone for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). From setting up an IAM user with proper permissions to configuring pipelines for building, scanning, and deploying frontend and backend applications, you'll discover how to create a production-grade system designed for scalability and security.

#### Highlights include:

**Pipeline Automation:** Build, scan, and deploy Docker images using Jenkins, Trivy, and SonarQube.

**Cluster Monitoring:** Install Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application health with visual dashboards.

**GitOps with ArgoCD:** Achieve seamless application deployment and updates via Git repositories.

**End-to-End DevSecOps Workflow:** Incorporate security scans, monitoring, and scalable infrastructure for a production-ready deployment.


To make learning even easier, a detailed YouTube video accompanies this guide, walking you through each step visually. Whether you're a DevOps enthusiast or a seasoned cloud professional, this tutorial will help you bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation.
